# Bank_Customer_Churn
This Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model is designed with the primary objective of forecasting customer churn within a banking context, aiming to identify customers who are likely to terminate their relationship with the bank in the near future. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing historical customer information, including demographic details, transaction history, and various relevant features, the model employs advanced machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression and random forest algorithms. Key features considered in the prediction process include customer age, account tenure, transaction frequency, account balance, and interactions with customer service. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities. With a high degree of accuracy, the model not only provides a holistic view of customer churn but also enables the bank to implement targeted retention strategies effectively. The practical implications of the model's predictions include proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce overall churn rates. However, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations and constraints in the model's predictive capabilities.
